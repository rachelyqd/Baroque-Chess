'''Tring_Hard_BC_Player.py by Chen Bai and Chumei Yang
This is a game agent that plays Baroque chess automatically. It should follow the rules strictly.
The program should suppose the opponent as intelligent
and make its move based on the inference on the opponentâ€™s possible move.
Our goal is for the agent to have as many captures as possible thus winning the game.
The main algorithm used is minimax search with optimization including alpha-beta pruning and Zobrist hashing

Usage Example: python BaroqueGameMaster.py Trying_Hard_BC_Player other_agent 2
