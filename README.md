# Baroque-Chess
Final project in artificial intelligence class. A baroque chess game. We wrote our chess agent which implements
baroque chess rules, static evaluation, and optimization techniques such as minimax search, alpha-beta pruning, and 
zobrist hashing.

Trying_Hard_BC_Player is our agent and BaroqueGameMaster would be what you use to run the game.
